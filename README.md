Starter Kit
===========

A website generator on Gulp. I use it to create HTML wireframes, prototypes, that sort of thing.

## Get started

1. Install gulp if you havenâ€™t already, `npm install -g gulp`
2. `git clone git@github.com:jordanthomas/massive-hipster.git [project_name]`
3. `cd [project_name]`
4. `npm install`
5. `bundle install`
6. `gulp`
7. Enjoy.

**Note, at this point you _probably_ want to remove the `origin` remote and add your own so you can save your work to your own repo.**

## Tasks

`gulp default` - Starts a server and watcher.

`gulp clean` - Removes the `build` directory. Run before building for production to clean out any old files.

`gulp build` - Like the default task, but without a server or watcher.

## Uses

- Sass 3.3 (Ruby)
- Bourbon
- Neat
- Jade
- Normalize
- Font Awesome
