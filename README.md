Massive Hipster
===============

A website generator on Gulp. I use it to create HTML wireframes, prototypes, that sort of thing.

## Why "Massive Hipster"?

That's what Github suggested. I couldn't think of anything better, so, Massive Hipster it was.

## Get started

0. Install gulp if you havenâ€™t already, `npm install -g gulp`
1. `git clone git@github.com:jordanthomas/massive-hipster.git [project_name]`
2. `cd [project_name]`
3. `npm install`
4. `gulp`
5. Enjoy.

**Note, at this point you _probably_ want to remove the `origin` remote and add your own so you can save your work to your own repo.**

## Tasks

`gulp default` - Starts a server and watcher.

`gulp clean` - Removes the `build` directory. Run before building for production to clean out any old files.

`gulp build` - Like the default task, but without a server or watcher.

## Uses

- Sass (via libass, install it with Homebrew)
- Bourbon
- Neat
- Jade
- Normalize
- Font Awesome
